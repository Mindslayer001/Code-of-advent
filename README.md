# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** solutions repository! This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges starting from **2023** and onward. Each year, I'll be tackling these puzzles and sharing my approaches and code here.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year, with a directory for each year of participation. Each directory contains subfolders for each day's challenge.

```
.
├── 2024/
│   ├── Day01/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── Day02/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

- **`solution.py`**: The Python script containing my solution to the day's puzzle.
- **`input.txt`**: The input data for the day's challenge.
- **`README.md`**: A brief explanation of the problem and my approach.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mindslayer001/Code-of-advent
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired year and day to explore the solutions.

## Why Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming event that provides fun and challenging puzzles every day from December 1st to December 25th. It's a great way to:
- Improve problem-solving skills.
- Learn and practice programming.
- Compete and collaborate with others in the coding community.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python (may include additional languages in the future).
- **Tools**: Standard libraries, occasional external libraries for specific challenges.
